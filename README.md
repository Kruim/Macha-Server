#Getting Started

1. If you haven't already, download [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/) from Mojang and install it.
2. Download the specified version of [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft
    * _If you encounter issues try using 16 JDK._
3. Run the installed profile so it can perform initial setup
    * You'll know you have the right one as it should be an fabric icon / fabric version to the left of the _Play_ button.
4. Once you get to the main menu you can close the game
5. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Kruim/Macha-Server/releases) of Macha-Server
6. Back in the Minecraft Launcher, in the top navigation select _Installations_
7. Select the _Ellipsis (...)_ icon and select _Edit_ for the fabric installation
    * Rename the pack to whatever you want to call the server
    * Expand _More Options_ and remove the current `-Xmx` property from _JVM Arguements_
    * Add `-Xms7G -Xmx7G` to the beginning to give the installation more memory
      * 7 is just a recomendation. You can adjust as needed, but I'd reccomend at least 6 GB.
8. Select the _Folder_ icon for "Macha-Server" to open the installation location
    * Remove the existing `mods` folder and replace it with `mods` folder from the Macha-Server ZIP
    * Close the folder and return to the launcher
9. Launch and enjoy!
