Pack version: 3.0.0
Minecraft version: 1.16.5
Forge version: 36.0.46

   

Stability Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
I think it's only fair to warn everyone that modded minecraft is volatile and prone to breaking.

This is a WIP, so there are going to be some bumps along the way. As much as possible I'm going to try to preserve the world and mods that are in the pack when updating MC/Mod versions. But, there is a chance there will be world resets, or mods that break / aren't updated so they are removed. The idea is to keep the modlist minimal and on the latest version of MC as fast as possible.

That being said I don't want people to put in a bunch of work for nothing so there is the possibility of extended or experimental branches.

   

Getting Started
If you haven't already, download Minecraft from Mojang and install it.
Download the specified version of Forge Mod Loader for Minecraft
If you encounter issues try using 8 JDK.
For M1 Macs: I reccomend using Zulu OpenJDK. There aren't many (if any) other compiled versions of OpenJDK for ARMx64 Macs right now.
Run the installed profile so it can perform initial setup
You'll know you have the right one as it should be an anvil icon / forge version to the left of the Play button.
Once you get to the main menu you can close the game
Download the latest release of Valleycraft
Back in the Minecraft Launcher, in the top navigation select Installations
Select the Ellipsis (...) icon and select Edit for the forge installation
Rename the pack to "Valleycraft"
Expand More Options and remove the current -Xmx property from JVM Arguements
Add -Xms7G -Xmx7G to the beginning to give the installation more memory
7 is just a recomendation. You can adjust as needed, but I'd reccomend at least 6 GB.
For M1 Macs: Also add -Dfml.earlyprogresswindow=false (This is a temp fix as Forge seems to crash on boot without it)
Select the Folder icon for "Valleycraft" to open the installation location
Remove the existing mods folder and replace it with mods folder from the Valleycraft ZIP
Close the folder and return to the launcher
Launch and enjoy!
   

Updating
Download the latest release of Valleycraft
Note: If forge needs to be updated, update Forge first!
Open the Minecraft Launcher
From the top navigation select Installations
Select the Folder icon for "Valleycraft" to open the installation location
Remove the existing mods folder and replace it with mods folder from the Valleycraft ZIP
Close the folder and return to the launcher
Launch and enjoy!
   

Updating Forge
Under the forge subfolder for the current version you'll find the current version of forge for the pack
e.g. forge-<$MC_VERSION>-<$FORGE_VERSION>-installer.jar
Double-click the jar file and run the installer
Make sure you install to the same location as your previous install (unless you know what you are doing)
Make sure when you boot the launcher, the listed forge version matches that listed in the readme
   

Connecting
From Multiplayer, select Add Server
Enter the following:
Server Name: Valleycraft
Server Address: valley.hearth.adam.wtf
No port is required!
As long as the server is up you should see the icon populate and version populate (e.g., Valleycraft 2.x.y )
